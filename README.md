This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App]

This is minified version(without node_modules)

In order to run and make it ready to go, in the project directory you have to use following commands via terminal:

### `npm install`

### `cd beach-resort-final`

### `npm start`

The app will run in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

# App Usage

The project uses [https://reqres.in/] api.
Registration is imitated, so the only thing you need in order to use the app is to login with already provided:
`email`: `eve.holt@reqres.in`(only this email works for testing purposes)
`password`: `cityslicka` (or any other password you'd like)

# Production mode

Note that the development build is not suitable for production.
We already made sure to use the production build for deployment using:

### `npm run build`

If just viewing the app is your only purpose you can always see already finished production version which is hosted on serverless platform [https://www.netlify.com/]:
